## Overview

**PolyerGalio** (Greek for "multiple tools") is a collection of implemented machine learning methods ranging from  
data encoding and processing pipelines to supervised learning and clustering.

The focus of this repository is:
- **Classic and alternative ML algorithms implemented with a unified 
  interface**
- **Numerical stability and performance**
- **Novel extensions and original research contributions**

All algorithms are implemented in **NumPy** and **SciPy**, with minimal external dependencies.

---
## Installation

```bash
pip install polyergalio
```

For local development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
```
