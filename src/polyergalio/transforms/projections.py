    Multiple correspondence analysis of a one-hot table.

    Correspondence analysis works on the correspondence matrix P = N / N.sum()
    and compares it against what independence would predict. The expected table
    is the outer product of the row and column MASSES -- the marginals of P, not
    the raw counts -- so that expectation and observation are on the same scale
    and the standardized residuals sum to the table's total inertia.

    Returns row principal coordinates, one row per sample, the same orientation
    pca() returns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : one-hot encoded array, (num_samples, num_indicator_columns)
    top_k_components : number of axes to keep

    Returns
    -------
